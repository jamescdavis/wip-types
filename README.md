# wip-types
A central (unofficial) place for community development of TypeScript type definitions relevant to Ember.js

WARNING! These type definitions are works in progress and are highly likely to be incorrect and/or incomplete. Use at your own risk! As you find issues, please submit PRs!

The intention of this repo is to serve a place where the TypeScript + Ember.js community can work together to develop type declarations for JavaScript packages relevant to building Ember.js apps and addons.

By submitting type declarations here, you agree to licence them under the MIT license. We have chosen this license because it is what DefinitelyType uses and the hope is that these definitions will be transferred there as they stabilize.
